## Eternal Currencies

A Modpack-focused Currency mod. originally designed for MC Eternal 2, as a standin for FTB Money in MC Eternal 2's 1.20 port.

Currently exclusive to Forge 1.20.1. Ports will be done as needed.


### Features
- Support for basically infinite unique Currencies.
- Add new Currencies through JSON files in Datapacks, by adding them to the "/eternalcurrencies/currencies/" directory in any namespace.
- An Item that can be consumed and grants Currencies based on NBT Data.
- A (hopefully) solid API, for other mod developers to utilize.
- Native FTB Quests integration. Currency Tasks and Rewards!
- Native KubeJS integration. access our [API Helper](https://github.com/Minecraft-Eternal/eternal-currencies/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mceternal/eternalcurrencies/api/EternalCurrenciesAPI.java) by name, without any setup!
- Commands to edit the Currency levels of players.
- A system to share Currencies between multiple Players (or even things owned by those players!). No need to transfer when you're working as a team!
- [Future] "Bank Block" to deposit and store your currencies.
- [Active WIP] Modpack/Server Shop GUI similar to FTB Money, with support for assigning multiple currencies to shop entries, either required or a choice between. Probably some kind of Auto-buyer too!
- [Future] Player Shop system, details are undecided.
